# tommy teaches tommy: Godot (v4.0) Game Development

__tommy teaches tommy__ (_and anyone else who cares to read all this_) about software development and coding with GDScript and how to create scenes and videogame functionality with Godot Engine (v4.x).

(Godot)[https://godotengine.org/] is a free and open-source Game Engine for videogame development, letting you manage assets, create scenes, manage user input through various controllers, and all the general pieces of creating videogames.

Console gaming requires licensing and access to the development SDKs for the consoles, which often also seems to require establishing a business with a valid Tax Identification Number (TIN) for your country of origin. I'm not doing all that, and I'm working mostly in macOS (Apple), so I'll only be testing this stuff as an installable/runnable desktop app for macOS or as exported for a self-hosted web-based application that should be playable through modern web-browsers.

## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

_"What's in a name?"_

You can see a rambly explanation [here at my personal website](https://tommypkeane.com/about-tommy/tommy-teaches-tommy.html); but, in short:

I'm just trying to say that I'm writing out what I think is helpful/interesting to me, and I'm sharing it in case it's helpful to anyone else, but please know that I'm ___not___ trying to talk _down_ to anyone :smile: (except maybe myself :ghost:). I'll also probably use the "academic we" in the docs, and spell things like a jerk ... but you get what you paid for, and this is free. So, enjoy! :smile:
